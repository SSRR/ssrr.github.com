<DT>"Organizational aspects concerning the deployment of RPAS in emergency-situations"
<DD>by Geert De Cubber (Royal Military Academy of Belgium)
<BR>
Geert De Cubber was born on February 13, 1979 in Halle, Belgium. In
2001, he received the degree of Master in Engineering at the Vrije
Universiteit Brussel (VUB), with as specialization Electro-Mechanical
Engineering. He then obtained a PhD. for his research in the field of
3-dimensional reconstruction of natural scenes perceived by mobile
robots. Geert joined the Unmanned Vehicle Centre of the Belgian Royal
Military Academy (RMA) where his main task is to apply computer vision
techniques to mobile robots, rendering these robots able to perceive,
analyze, and ? to some degree ? understand their environment. More
specifically, three-dimensional reconstruction and cognitive vision
approaches are investigated with the aim to port the capabilities of the
human eyesight to intelligent robots. Currently, he is the coordinator
of the European project ICARUS which targets the development of unmanned
tools (land, air and ground robots) for search and rescue activities
after a major crisis (earthquake, tsunami).
<DT>summary:
<DD>Remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) are more and more being used by
emergency management authorities, as they prove to be a very valuable
tool, notably for increasing the situational awareness of the first
responders. However, these crisis managers are still confronted with
important bottlenecks impeding the practical usage of these novel
technological tools. Organizational, procedural, legal, ethical and
deployment issues need to be tackled prior to starting any operation
with RPAS in order to ensure the possibility of rapid deployment in an
international context when a disaster does strike. In this presentation,
an overview of these "non-technological" aspects requiring community
attention are discussed, with the aim of starting a discussion fostering
the uptake of RPAS technology for crisis management.

Hiromu Okada is an emeritus professor of Hokkaido University and a board member of Crisis and Environmental Management Policy Institute (CeMI). 
He predicted the eruption of Mount Usu in Hokkaido in 2000, leading to the safety evacuation of residents more than 15,000. He is known as "the doctor in charge of Usu Volcano."<DT>summary:

<DL>
<DT>"Humanoid Robotics and Disaster Response"
<DD><img src="Figs/Inaba.jpg" alt=""/>  by Masayuki Inaba (The University of Tokyo) <BR>
Masayuki Inaba is a Professor in the Information Science and
Technology, Graduate School at the University of Tokyo. He graduated
from the department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of
Tokyo in 1981, and received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the graduate
school of Information Engineering at The University of Tokyo in 1983
and 1986 respectively. He was appointed as a lecturer in the
Department of Mechanical Engineering at The University of Tokyo in
1986, an associate professor in 1989, and a professor in the
Department of Mechano-Informatics in 2000, and also a professor in new
Department of Creative Informatics from 2005. He is directing the JSK
Robotics Lab at The University of Tokyo. 
His research interests include key technologies of robotic systems and
software architectures to advance robotics research. His research
projects have included hand-eye coordination in rope handling,
vision-based robotic server system, remote-brained robot approach,
whole-body behaviors in humanoids, robot sensor suit with electrically
conductive fabric, flexible spined humanoid and developmental JSK
mother projects with the remote-brained system environment, life-size
assistive humanoids, musculoskeletal spined humanoid series,
whole-body soft sensor tissues, IRT home assitance with personal
mobility, open-source robotics middlewares, high speed-and-powered
legs for the next generation humanoid, on the budget from MEXT. The
graduate students from his lab created a company SCHAFT with the
humanoid technology to apply DARPA Robotics Challenge in 2012 and
achieved first place in DRC Trials.
He received several awards including outstanding Paper Awards in 1987,
1998 and 1999 from the Robotics Society of Japan, JIRA Awards in 1994,
ROBOMECH Awards in 1994 and 1996 from the division of Robotics and
Mechatronics of Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers, and Best Paper
Awards of International Conference on Humanoids in 2000 and 2006 with
JSK Robotics Lab members.
<DT>summary:
<DD>Humanoid robotics is the research on intelligent robots that perform
tasks which humans are capable of, in human environments, using tools
used by humans.  The DARPA Robotics Challenge that began in 2012 was
designed to be a disaster response challenge with the goal of having a
single robot capable of performing the initial disaster response in
human environments, using equipment and tools used by humans, within
the first twenty-four hours of the disaster' s occurrence.  At times
when disasters occur, intelligent robots that perform tasks which only
humans could perform, in human environments using tools used by
humans, are wanted as disaster response robots.  This talk will
provide an introduction to the research conducted at the University of
Tokyo, from intelligent robots research to the current humanoid
research, as well as the tasks anticipated in the Disaster Response
Challenge, participating team's approach, and the situation of Japan,
which is advancing towards the finals.

<H3>Workshop</H3>
<H4>"Obstacles on the way to a broad deployment of robot technology in disaster response"</H4>
<H4>Oct. 27 (Mon.) 14:00-17:30 / Room-B</H4>
<DL>
<DT> Organizers:
<DD> Robin Murphy (Texas A&ampM University), Andreas Ciossek(Cobham Mission Equipment), Gerald Steinbauer(Graz University of Technology)
<DT>Backgound:
<DD>Due to great advances in research and technology recently robots - mainly unmanned aerial vehicles, but also ground, underwater and surface vehicles ? gained a lot of attention and interest by national and international organizations concerned with disaster response. There are many interesting examples where robot technology has been successfully contributed to the mitigation of disasters such as hurricane Katrina, Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, and recent floods on the Balkan. Although, the technology has been proven to be useful and mature a broad deployment of robot technology and all neighboring technologies such as computer vision and mapping is hardly seen. Obviously, there are still a number of serious obstacles that prevent a broad deployment.
There are still a number of unsolved technical problems such as performance, robustness, endurance, and operability. These questions will be usually addressed by technical programs of events like the SSRR.
<DD>In this special session we like to target other groups of obstacles such as organizational, operational, tactical, legal, and ethical issues. For this session we like to invite responders, policy makers, researchers and industry to discuss which obstacles are in the way and how these obstacles can be removed. It is envisioned to collect these issues but also best practice examples and to initiate the development of a road map.
<BR>
<DT>The related topics are (but not limited to):
<DD>- possible and realistic use cases
<DD>- chain of command and responsibility
<DD>- legal issues  and liability
<DD>- operator and responder training for new technologies
<DD>- equipment certification and maintenance
<DD>- models for sharing and providing technology
<DD>- activation mechanisms for technology on national and international level

Disaster Risk Reduction held every ten years.  Ministers from all over
the world will participate in the conference, and it has major impact on
the policy of each nation.  It is surprizing that the pre-document of
post-2015 action framework does not include much about technologies, and
almost nothing about robotics.  We would like to throw a stone by
organizing a public forum or a talk in main session.
